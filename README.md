# Flutter: Exposure Documentation
This project is the paperless solution for keeping track of the documentation for exposure sessions.


## Access
Since no external services are being used (except  hosting), the app is free.
The future plan is to host it at [Exposure Documentation](exposure.mwinkler.tech).
Users will probably feed very confidential data into the app. To prove that the data is not used or intercepted, this app is open source. At the same time, the app is made available as a website via https so that all information is encrypted anyway.

## Features
- exposure documentation
- being able to generate a pdf document from the given answers to share and save it in your own safe storage
